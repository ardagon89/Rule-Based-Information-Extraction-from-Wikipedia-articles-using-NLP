1) For WORK template do we have to extract instances only when they contain Person and Organization or should we also extract from sentences like 
"In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter."
"He owned farms, town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners."

2) Does BUY template only extract instances when an Organization is bought or can it include purchase of all items like farms, book, apple, etc.
