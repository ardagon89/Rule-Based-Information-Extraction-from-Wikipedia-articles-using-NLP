John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, as the child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, in a one-room log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Brookline, Massachusetts. John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's westward migration, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. On November 22, 1963, Samuel's grandson and great-grandson was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.
